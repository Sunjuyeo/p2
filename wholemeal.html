  <h2>Wholemeal cereals and breads, potatoes, pasta and rice</h2>
    <p>Foods on this shelf are the best energy providers for your body, so the more active you are the more you need.</p>
  <h2>How many servings should I have a day?</h2>
    <p>Choose three to five servings a day. Up to seven servings for teenage boys and men aged 19-50. Very active people will need more.</p>
  <h2>What type of foods should I eat?</h2>
    <p>The healthiest starchy foods are those that are high in fibre. For most starchy foods, there is a high-fibre version you can choose. So try out brown rice, wholemeal pasta and wholegrain bread instead of white rice, white pasta and white bread. Wholegrain breakfast cereals (including porridge) and baked potatoes eaten with their skins are great for fibre too.</p>
  <h2>What is serving?</h2>
    <P>The actual portion that you eat may be bigger or smaller than the servings listed in the Food Pyramid. For example, a sandwich with two thin slices of wholemeal bread counts as one serving. One medium potato counts as half a serving.</p>
  <h3>One serving is</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 thin slices wholemeal bread</li>
      <li>1 ½ slices wholemeal soda bread or 1 pitta pocket</li>
      <li>⅓ cup dry porridge oats or ½ cup unsweetened muesli</li>
      <li>1 cup flaked type breakfast cereal</li>
      <li>1 cup of cooked rice, pasta, noodles or cous cous</li>
      <li>2 medium or 4 small potatoes</li>
      <li>1 cup yam or plantain</li>
    </ul>
