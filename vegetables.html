  <h2>Vegetables, salad and fruit</h2>
      <p>Fruit and vegetables provide fibre. They also provide many important vitamins and minerals and are low in calories.</p>
  <h2>How many servings should I have a day?</h2>
      <p>Choose five to seven servings a day.</p>
  <h2>What types of foods should I eat?</h2>
      <p>Fresh, local fruit and vegetables in season are best and can be very good value. Eat a variety of coloured fruit and vegetables - green, yellow, orange, red and purple in order to benefit from the variety of vitamins and minerals provided by each colour group. Include a vitamin C rich fruit each day such as orange or orange juice, strawberries or blackberries. Count fruit juice and smoothies as only one serving each day as they may low in fibre.</p>
